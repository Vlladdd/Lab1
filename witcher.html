<p>Played in an open world with a third-person perspective, players control protagonist Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a witcher,
     who seeks to find his adopted daughter on the run from the "Wild Hunt", an otherworldly force determined to capture and utilise her powers.
      Throughout the game, players battle against the world's many dangers using weapons and magic, interact with various non-player characters, 
      and complete main story quests, side quests, monster contracts, and treasure hunts to acquire experience points and gold used to increase 
      Geralt's various abilities and gear. The game's central story features multiple endings that are determined by Geralt's choices made 
      by the player during certain points of the story.</p>
