<p>Played in an open world with a third-person perspective, players control protagonist Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a witcher,
     who seeks to find his adopted daughter on the run from the "Wild Hunt", an otherworldly force determined to capture and utilise her powers.
      Throughout the game, players battle against the world's many dangers using weapons and magic, interact with various non-player characters, 
      and complete main story quests, side quests, monster contracts, and treasure hunts to acquire experience points and gold used to increase 
      Geralt's various abilities and gear. The game's central story features multiple endings that are determined by Geralt's choices made 
      by the player during certain points of the story.<br><br>Development began in 2011 and lasted for three-and-a-half years, of which over 
      two-and-a-half years were devoted to voice recording. The writing was infused with real-life aspects in a deliberate attempt to avoid simplification, 
      impart authenticity, and reflect Sapkowski's novels. Europe was the basis of the game's open world, with Poland, Amsterdam, and Scandinavia its primary inspirations. 
      REDengine 3 enabled the developer to create a complex story without compromising the game world, whose size was enlarged by PlayStation 4 and Xbox One technology. 
      The music was primarily composed by Marcin Przybyłowicz and performed in Germany by the Brandenburg State Orchestra.<br><br>
    The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 19 May 2015. 
    The game received critical acclaim, with praise of its gameplay, narrative, world design, combat, and visuals, although it suffered some criticism due to technical issues,
    some of which were later patched. It was 2015's most-awarded game, receiving Game of the Year awards from gaming publications, critics, and award events,
    and is considered one of the greatest games of all time. The game was a commercial success, selling over six million copies within six weeks of its release and ten million copies overall. 
    Two expansion packs, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine, were also released. A Game of the Year edition, with the base game, expansion packs and all downloadable content, was released in August 2016.</p>
