The game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. 
Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives, 
the Terrorists, depending on the game mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages, 
while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted or rescue the hostages. 
There are six game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. 
Global Offensive has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, 
as well as allowing members of the community to host their own servers with custom maps and game modes. 
Global Offensive has a competitive scene, with Valve-sponsored tournaments known as the "Majors" being the premier competitive event for the game.</p>
